Your task is to build a complete Personal Finance Tracker with user accounts and full financial tracking features.

The tracker must integrate cleanly across the database, backend, and frontend so the entire system works end-to-end.

## Requirements
The application must support:

- Login and registration
- Adding a new transaction
  - amount, type (income or expense), category, optional note
- Viewing all transactions
- A financial summary showing:
  - total income
  - total expenses
  - current balance
- Graphs (using Recharts):
  - a bar chart of total expense by category
  - an income vs expense comparison bar chart
  - a monthly spending trend line

## Goal

The entire app should work end-to-end and be ready for production.  
All login flows, forms, actions, and API calls must function correctly so the finance tracker behaves like a real, usable application.

Feel free to organize the directory however you like. Please provide in the end the list of commands I can run to use the app. The initial code is just template code that you can modify or remove.
