Your task is to build a complete text classification dashboard for spam detection.

## Requirements

The system must integrate an end-to-end ML pipeline with a frontend dashboard.  
It must support the following:

- Run an ML pipeline on the backend:
  - load a small text dataset from scikit-learn
  - build two preprocessing pipelines
  - train Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
  - evaluate both models
  - generate example predictions

- Build a frontend dashboard using React + Vite:
  - button to run the evaluation
  - display the model accuracies
  - show a simple chart (via Recharts)
  - show example predictions
  - show a brief summary of preprocessing pipelines

## Goal

The entire system should work end-to-end.  
The dashboard should fetch results from the backend and display them clearly, so the spam classifier behaves an interactive ML presentation.
