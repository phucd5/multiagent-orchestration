- If your manager ask you a question ALWAYS respond to them.
- Always report back to your manager with what you are doing when you are done. DO NOT send code to your manager, only provide a brief update on what you accomplished.

# Codebase Environment Guidelines

This set of codebase environment guidelines applies to everyone. Please follow them carefully (eg, if your role is not to write code, then you do not need to pay attention to the patch file requirements, since you should not be creating them anyway).
